<td width="100%"; colspan="2";>  Kazhdan and Lusztig famously parametrized the Iwahori-spherical representations of split reductive p-adic groups. That can be considered as one of the first instances of the local Langlands correspondence, and as a starting point for the role of affine Hecke algebras in the Langlands program. 
In this talk we discuss the local Langlands correspondence for all principal series representations of quasi-split reductive p-adic groups, which was established recently. 
This is a generalization of the Iwahori-spherical case which still bears considerable similarity with that case. 
However, the proof is in many ways completely different from the work of Kazhdan--Lusztig. 
For example, in our setting the affine Hecke algebras do not arise from types, and in these algebras different roots may have different q-parameters. 
We will explain some parts of the proof of the correspondence, in particular how generic representations are used to make it canonical.

<td width="100%"; colspan="2";> I will introduce quasi-polynomial generalizations of the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials ("quasi" in the sense that monomials are allowed to have non-integral exponents). 
A key tool in their construction is the explicit realization of standard Y-cyclic double affine Hecke algebra modules on spaces of quasi-polynomials. 
I will explain how metaplectic Iwahori-Whittaker functions can be retrieved as limit cases. 
It involves a suitable re-parametrization of the induction data in terms of metaplectic data.

This is joint work with Siddhartha Sahi and Vidya Venkateswaran.
