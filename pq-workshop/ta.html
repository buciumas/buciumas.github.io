Recent advancements in AI techniques have led Williamson and a DeepMind research team to develop a novel algorithm for computing S_n Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.
In a work with Chuijia Wang, we offer an explanation of how the so-called hypercube decomposition can be understood through the lens of the parabolic induction paradigm from representation theory.
Consequently, we construct a generalization of this outlook to the case of a finite Coxeter system and a given parabolic subgroup. Curiously, some long-known Hecke algebra positivity phenomena of Dyer-Lehrer and Grojnowski-Haiman fit elegantly in the new approach.
In this talk I would also like to emphasize an underlying theme of categorification of the S_n Hecke algebra by modules over affine Hecke algebras or their corresponding quiver Hecke algebras.</td>

<tr>
<td width="100%"; colspan="2";> This is a report on a joint work with D. Gaitsgory, which is a part of the metaplectic geometric Langlands program. 
For a reductive group G over an algebraically closed field a metaplectic geometric datum is a factorizable gerbe g on the affine grassmanian of G. 
This datum gives rise to metaplectic Whittaker category Whit_g(G) of some twisted sheaves on the affine grassmanian. 
It also gives rise to the metaplectic dual group H of (G, g), which is an analog of the Langlands dual group for the trivial gerbe. 
The category Rep(H) of representations of H acts on Whit_g(G) by Hecke functors and gives rise to the category of graded Hecke eigen-objects with respect to this action  
The small fundamental local equivalence describes the latter category in terms of some factorizable sheaves on the configuration space of divisors on a curve. 
The proof being very long, we will discuss at least some ideas around this.

<tr>
<td width="100%"; colspan="2";> In the representation theory of reductive p-adic groups, it is a well-known result of Bernstein that the blocks of the category of all smooth complex representations correspond to inertial classes of supercuspidal pairs. 
This is no longer the case when the field of complex numbers is replaced by a field of positive characteristic different from p. 
I will give a brief overview of the current situation, and will discuss in more detail the case of finite length representations of inner forms of GL(N).

<tr>
<td width="100%"; colspan="2";>  Kazhdan and Lusztig famously parametrized the Iwahori-spherical representations of split reductive p-adic groups. That can be considered as one of the first instances of the local Langlands correspondence, and as a starting point for the role of affine Hecke algebras in the Langlands program. 
In this talk we discuss the local Langlands correspondence for all principal series representations of quasi-split reductive p-adic groups, which was established recently. 
This is a generalization of the Iwahori-spherical case which still bears considerable similarity with that case. 
However, the proof is in many ways completely different from the work of Kazhdan--Lusztig. 
For example, in our setting the affine Hecke algebras do not arise from types, and in these algebras different roots may have different q-parameters. 
We will explain some parts of the proof of the correspondence, in particular how generic representations are used to make it canonical.

</tr>

<tr>
<td width="100%"; colspan="2";> I will introduce quasi-polynomial generalizations of the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials ("quasi" in the sense that monomials are allowed to have non-integral exponents). 
A key tool in their construction is the explicit realization of standard Y-cyclic double affine Hecke algebra modules on spaces of quasi-polynomials. 
I will explain how metaplectic Iwahori-Whittaker functions can be retrieved as limit cases. 
It involves a suitable re-parametrization of the induction data in terms of metaplectic data.

This is joint work with Siddhartha Sahi and Vidya Venkateswaran.
