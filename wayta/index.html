<p> <b>General Information:</b>
The What Are You Thinking About? (WAYTA) Seminar is a biweekly in person mathematics seminar held at the Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics in Amsterdam focusing on representation theory, mathematical physics and related areas.
The goal of the seminar is to allow researchers at or near the KdVI to discuss their most recent research interests, or give introductory talks about topical research areas.
If you are interested in giving a talk in the seminar, please contact one of the organizers.

<p><b>Organizers:</b> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/valentinbuciumas/home">Valentin Buciumas</a>
and <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/i/s/m.isachenkov/m.isachenkov.html">Mikhail Isachenkov</a>
and <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.v.stokman/">Jasper Stokman</a>.
If you would like to be on the mailing list, please email Misha at m dot isachenkov at gmail dot com.</p>

<p><b>Time and Place:</b> The WAYTA seminar will take place in person at KdVI in the seminar room F3.20.
The seminar will usually take place on Thursdays starting at 4pm.
After 5pm there is room for a more informal continuation with part of the audience, which might well continue at some point at the Polder.
<br>
Due to COVID measures, at most 10 people are currently allowed to be physically in the seminar room.
Because of this, we require interested participants to register for the talks they want to attend by emailing Misha.
We're happy to welcome you without a registration if the capacity of the room has not been reached.

<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> The classical Satake isomorphisms is one of the stepping stones of the Langlands programme.
It states that the spherical Hecke algebra of a p-adic reductive group can be identified with the Grothendieck ring of the category of representations of the dual group.
In this setup, one may study the Whittaker module, which contains information about unramified Whittaker functions and show that it is isomorphic to the spherical Hecke algebra.
Understanding a certain basis of the Whittaker module produces the Casselman-Shalika formula.
In this talk I will present some ideas on how to generalise this setup to the setting of metaplectic p-adic groups where the category of representations of the quantum group at a root of unity will appear.
