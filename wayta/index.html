<h2 style="text-align:center;color:rgb(196, 30, 58);"> WAYTA Seminar in Representation Theory and Mathematical Physics</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(196, 30, 58);">University of Amsterdam / Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics</h3>



<p> <b>General Information:</b>
The What Are You Thinking About? (WAYTA) Seminar is a biweekly in person mathematics seminar held at the Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics in Amsterdam focusing on representation theory, mathematical physics and related areas.
The goal of the seminar is to allow researchers at or near the KdVI to discuss their most recent research interests, or give introductory talks about topical research areas.
If you are interested in giving a talk in the seminar, please contact one of the organizers.

<p><b>Organizers:</b> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/valentinbuciumas/home">Valentin Buciumas</a>
and <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/i/s/m.isachenkov/m.isachenkov.html">Mikhail Isachenkov</a>
and <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.v.stokman/">Jasper Stokman</a>.
If you would like to be on the mailing list, please email Misha at m dot isachenkov at gmail dot com.</p>

<p><b>Time and Place:</b> The WAYTA seminar will take place in person at KdVI in the seminar room F3.20.
The seminar will usually take place on Thursdays starting at 4pm.
After 5pm there is room for a more informal continuation with part of the audience, which might well continue at some point at the Polder.
<br>
Due to COVID measures, at most 10 people are currently allowed to be physically in the seminar room.
Because of this, we require interested participants to register for the talks they want to attend by emailing Misha.
We're happy to welcome you without a registration if the capacity of the room has not been reached.

<b>Quantum-metaplectic dualities via the Whittaker model</b></a>
</td>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> The classical Satake isomorphisms is one of the stepping stones of the Langlands programme.
It states that the spherical Hecke algebra of a p-adic reductive group can be identified with the Grothendieck ring of the category of representations of the dual group.
In this setup, one may study the Whittaker module, which contains information about unramified Whittaker functions and show that it is isomorphic to the spherical Hecke algebra.
Understanding a certain basis of the Whittaker module produces the Casselman-Shalika formula.
In this talk I will present some ideas on how to generalise this setup to the setting of metaplectic p-adic groups where the category of representations of the quantum group at a root of unity will appear.

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> I will explain how (a quotient of) Onsager algebra and affine Temperley-Lieb algebra emerge from ``Generalised Clifford algebra''.
  The construction can be extended to more general case, related to the recent development of generalised Onsager algebra.
  I will give several concrete examples of motivated from the physics of exactly solvable model.
  These examples can be considered as a (new) generalisation of the Ising model.

<b>Crossing equations and Rankin-Selberg identities</b>
</a>
</td>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5">  <b>This talk is online due to the current lockdown measures in the Netherlands.</b>
  <br>
  <b>Abstract:</b> I will show how a specific type of Rankin-Selberg identity for automorphic forms on a real reductive group is analogous to the conformal crossing equation for correlation functions in CFT.
  We will discuss some examples and implications of this fact.
  The talk is based on my work in preparation.

<b>ansWers And questions - Yangians eT spin chAins</b>
</a>
</td>
</tr>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b>
  As several of you know I'm interested in quantum-integrable long-range spin chains.
  These quantum-mechanical models for magnetism have a rich representation-theoretic structure.
  In this talk I will focus on the 'isotropic' level and explore the connection between the Yangian of gl_2 and spin chains.
<br>
I will briefly review the role of the Yangian in the context of the Heisenberg XXX spin chain.
<br>
Then I'll introduce the Haldane--Shastry spin chain and explain what is known about its Yangian symmetry.
In particular I will use affine Schur--Weyl duality between the degenerate affine Hecke algebra and the Yangian to derive the Yangian generators for Haldane--Shastry that were conjectured by Ha, Haldane and others nearly 30 years ago.
<br>
Finally I will turn to a correspondence, part established in collaboration with Rob Klabbers (Humboldt U) and part conjectural, between Yangian irreps for Haldane--Shastry and solutions to the Bethe-ansatz equations of Heisenberg.
I will end with some puzzles that keep me busy at the moment.

<b>Elliptic Racah polynomials</b>

</td>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> Upon solving a finite discrete reduction of the difference Heun equation, we arrive at an elliptic generalization of the Racah polynomials.
  We exhibit the three-term recurrence relation and the orthogonality relations for these elliptic Racah polynomials.
  The well-known q-Racah polynomials of Askey and Wilson are recovered as a trigonometric limit.
  Joint work with Jan Felipe van Diejen.

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will discuss recent joint work with Ferenc Bencs, David de Boer and Pjotr Buys in which we determine the critical temperature for uniqueness of the Gibbs measure of the anti-ferromagnetic Potts model on the infinite regular tree (also known as the Bethe lattice).
  This confirms a folklore conjecture.

<b>Matrix models: asymptotics, transesseries, theta functions and all that</b>
</a>
</td>
</tr>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> Matrix integrals are very nice toy models for physicists, having a level of difficulty in between ordinary integrals and path integrals - and in contrast to the latter, being perfectly well-defined.
  Like the path integrals that appear in quantum field theory, matrix integrals can be approximated using (asymptotic) perturbative expansions, but the true interesting physics is hidden in their nonperturbative content.
  This leads us to the realm of &Eacute;calle's theory of resurgence, where concepts like alien derivatives and transseries play an important role.
  Fascinating links with modular forms and theta functions also show up.

<b>Schur-Weyl and Gelfand-Tsetlin and Vershik-Okounkov</b>
</a>
</td>
</tr>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> Set g = gl(n,C) and V = C<sup>n</sup> its natural representation.
  It is a classical result that the d-fold tensor product of V decomposes as g-module into a direct sum of irreducible components of highest weight w = (w<sub>1</sub>, ... , w<sub>n</sub>) a partition of n, each appearing with multiplicity given by the number of standard Young tableaux of shape w.
  This can be proved by a purely combinatorial argument about weights, or using representation theory of the symmetric group and Schur-Weyl duality.
  <p>
  In the 50's Gelfand and Tsetlin gave a construction of a distinguished basis for any irreducible representation of g.
  In 2008, Vershik and Okounkov gave an analogous construction for irreducible representations of the symmetric group.
  In both cases the basis arises as the set of common eigenvectors of a maximal commutative subalgebra of the enveloping algebra of g and the group algebra of the symmetric group, respectively.
  Our [unachieved] aim is to see these bases inside the d-fold tensor product of V, and discuss some intermediate results.
  <p>
  This is being thought about in collaboration with Joanna Meinel from Bonn University.

<b>Dynamics of many-body quantum systems: Integrability, from Newton's cradle to Gibbs' grave</b>
</a>
</td>
</tr>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b>
  Recent years have demonstrated that integrability can be used to compute many physical properties of experimentally-accessible magnetic or cold atomic systems.
  Besides their rich equilibrium dynamics, such systems also host relaxation and equilibration behaviour which cannot be simply described by traditional textbook methods, and can lead to long-lived non-thermal equilibrium states.
  This talk will provide an overview of recent work in this area, and introduce some new methods to treat quenched and driven systems in various contexts.
