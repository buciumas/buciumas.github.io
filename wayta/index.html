<h2 style="text-align:center;color:rgb(196, 30, 58);"> WAYTA Seminar in Representation Theory and Mathematical Physics</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(196, 30, 58);">University of Amsterdam / Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics</h3>



<p> <b>General Information:</b>
The What Are You Thinking About? (WAYTA) Seminar is a biweekly in person mathematics seminar held at the Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics in Amsterdam focusing on representation theory, mathematical physics and related areas.
The goal of the seminar is to allow researchers at or near the KdVI to discuss their most recent research interests, or give introductory talks about topical research areas.
If you are interested in giving a talk in the seminar, please contact one of the organizers.

<p><b>Organizers:</b> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/valentinbuciumas/home">Valentin Buciumas</a>
and <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/i/s/m.isachenkov/m.isachenkov.html">Mikhail Isachenkov</a>
and <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.v.stokman/">Jasper Stokman</a>.
If you would like to be on the mailing list, please email Misha at m dot isachenkov at gmail dot com.</p>

<p><b>Time and Place:</b> The WAYTA seminar will take place in person at KdVI in the seminar room F3.20 (unless otherwise noted).
If the speaker connects via Zoom, we will still be in F3.20 projecting the talk.
The seminar will usually take place on Friday starting at 3pm (Amsterdam time!) and last for 1h or 1:30h.
After 4pm/4:30pm there is room for a more informal continuation with part of the audience, which might well continue at some point at the Polder.

<b>Quasi-hereditary covers, Hecke subalgebras and quantum wreath product</b></a>
</td>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b>
  The Hecke algebra is in general not quasi-hereditary, meaning that its module category is not a highest weight category; while it admits a quasi-hereditary cover via category O for certain rational Cherednik algebras due to Ginzburg-Guay-Opdam-Rouquier.
  It was proved in type A that this category O can be realized using q-Schur algebra, but this realization problem remains open beyond types A/B/C.
  An essential step for type D is to study Hu's Hecke subalgebra, which deforms from a wreath product that is not a Coxeter group.
  In this talk, I'll talk about a new theory allowing us to take the 'quantum wreath product' of an algebra by a Hecke algebra.
  Our wreath product produces the Ariki-Koike algebra as a special case, as well as new 'Hecke algebras' of wreath products between symmetric groups.
  We expect them to play a role in answering the realization problem for complex reflection groups.
  This is a joint work with Dan Nakano and Ziqing Xiang.

<b>Quantum-metaplectic dualities via the Whittaker model</b></a>
</td>
</tr>


<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> The classical Satake isomorphisms is one of the stepping stones of the Langlands programme.
It states that the spherical Hecke algebra of a p-adic reductive group can be identified with the Grothendieck ring of the category of representations of the dual group.
In this setup, one may study the Whittaker module, which contains information about unramified Whittaker functions and show that it is isomorphic to the spherical Hecke algebra.
Understanding a certain basis of the Whittaker module produces the Casselman-Shalika formula.
In this talk I will present some ideas on how to generalise this setup to the setting of metaplectic p-adic groups where the category of representations of the quantum group at a root of unity will appear.

</td>
</tr>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b>
  As several of you know I'm interested in quantum-integrable long-range spin chains.
  These quantum-mechanical models for magnetism have a rich representation-theoretic structure.
  In this talk I will focus on the 'isotropic' level and explore the connection between the Yangian of gl_2 and spin chains.
<br>
I will briefly review the role of the Yangian in the context of the Heisenberg XXX spin chain.
<br>
Then I'll introduce the Haldane--Shastry spin chain and explain what is known about its Yangian symmetry.
In particular I will use affine Schur--Weyl duality between the degenerate affine Hecke algebra and the Yangian to derive the Yangian generators for Haldane--Shastry that were conjectured by Ha, Haldane and others nearly 30 years ago.
<br>
Finally I will turn to a correspondence, part established in collaboration with Rob Klabbers (Humboldt U) and part conjectural, between Yangian irreps for Haldane--Shastry and solutions to the Bethe-ansatz equations of Heisenberg.
I will end with some puzzles that keep me busy at the moment.

<b>Matrix models: asymptotics, transesseries, theta functions and all that</b>
</a>
</td>
</tr>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> Matrix integrals are very nice toy models for physicists, having a level of difficulty in between ordinary integrals and path integrals - and in contrast to the latter, being perfectly well-defined.
  Like the path integrals that appear in quantum field theory, matrix integrals can be approximated using (asymptotic) perturbative expansions, but the true interesting physics is hidden in their nonperturbative content.
  This leads us to the realm of &Eacute;calle's theory of resurgence, where concepts like alien derivatives and transseries play an important role.
  Fascinating links with modular forms and theta functions also show up.

<b>Schur-Weyl and Gelfand-Tsetlin and Vershik-Okounkov</b>

</td>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> Set g = gl(n,C) and V = C<sup>n</sup> its natural representation.
  It is a classical result that the d-fold tensor product of V decomposes as g-module into a direct sum of irreducible components of highest weight w = (w<sub>1</sub>, ... , w<sub>n</sub>) a partition of n, each appearing with multiplicity given by the number of standard Young tableaux of shape w.
  This can be proved by a purely combinatorial argument about weights, or using representation theory of the symmetric group and Schur-Weyl duality.

  In the 50's Gelfand and Tsetlin gave a construction of a distinguished basis for any irreducible representation of g.
  In 2008, Vershik and Okounkov gave an analogous construction for irreducible representations of the symmetric group.
  In both cases the basis arises as the set of common eigenvectors of a maximal commutative subalgebra of the enveloping algebra of g and the group algebra of the symmetric group, respectively.
  Our [unachieved] aim is to see these bases inside the d-fold tensor product of V, and discuss some intermediate results.

  This is being thought about in collaboration with Joanna Meinel from Bonn University.

<b>Dynamics of many-body quantum systems: Integrability, from Newton's cradle to Gibbs' grave</b>
</a>
</td>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b>
  Recent years have demonstrated that integrability can be used to compute many physical properties of experimentally-accessible magnetic or cold atomic systems.
  Besides their rich equilibrium dynamics, such systems also host relaxation and equilibration behaviour which cannot be simply described by traditional textbook methods, and can lead to long-lived non-thermal equilibrium states.
  This talk will provide an overview of recent work in this area, and introduce some new methods to treat quenched and driven systems in various contexts.

<b>Classification of irreducible representations of a Kazhdan-Patterson covering group of GL(r)</b>
</a>
</td>
</tr>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> The local Langlands correspondence for a general linear group over a non-archimedean local field is known for a while, which gives a bijection between the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of GL(r) and the set of equivalence classes of r-dimensional Weil-Deligne representations.
  To establish such a bijection, we first need to do that for cuspidal representations, which is indeed the most crucial and difficult step.
  Then, the problem reduces to classifying all the irreducible representations of GL(r) via cuspidal ones, which is due to Bernstein-Zelevinsky and Zelevinsky.
  Their methods are also adapted and improved by others including Tadic, Lapid-Minguez, Minguez-S&eacute;cherre to classify irreducible representations of an inner form of GL(r).
  In this talk, I will focus on explaining some key points in the proof of Zelevinsky classification, then I will explain how to adapt it to classify all the irreducible representations of a certain covering group of GL(r), i.e. a Kazhdan-Patterson covering group.
  This is a joint work with Erez Lapid and Eyal Kaplan.

<b>In between finite and p-adic groups in type A</b>
</a>
</td>
</tr>

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b>
  Using the Bruhat decomposition, a general linear group over a p-adic field may be thought of as a "quantum affine" version of a finite group of permutations.
I am currently exploring some possible implications of this analogy on the spectral properties of the two groups, and would like to present two specific points of view on standing problems in representation theory.

For one, restriction of an irreducible smooth representation to its finite counterpart gives a flexible definition of the notion of the wavefront set - an invariant of arithmetic significance which is often approached using microlocal analysis.

From another perspective, the class of cyclotomic Hecke algebras is a natural interpolation between the finite and p-adic groups. I will show how the class of RSK representations (developed with Erez Lapid) serves as a uniform bridge between the Langlands classification for the p-adic group and the classical Specht construction of the finite domain.

<tr style = "background: lightgrey;">
<td colspan="5"> <b>Abstract:</b> In the work of Kang, Kashiwara, Kim, and Oh, the Schur-Weyl duality between quantum affine algebras and affine Hecke algebras is extended to certain Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier (KLR) algebras, whose defining combinatorial datum is given by the poles of the normalised R-matrix on a set of representations.
In this talk, I will review their construction and introduce a "boundary" analogue, consisting of a Schur-Weyl duality between a quantum symmetric pair of affine type and a modified KLR algebras arising from a (framed) quiver with a contravariant involution.
With respect to the Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh construction, the extra combinatorial datum we take into account is given by the poles of the normalised K-matrix of the quantum symmetric pair.
